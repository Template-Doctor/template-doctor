# Template Doctor - Deployment Guide

**Simple steps to run Template Doctor locally or deploy to Azure**

---

## 🏠 Running Locally (For Testing & Development)

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- GitHub account

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Template-Doctor/template-doctor.git
   cd template-doctor
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/full-setup.sh
   ```
   - Choose option 1 (Local MongoDB - Docker)
   - Follow prompts to configure GitHub OAuth (or skip for basic testing)

3. **Start Template Doctor**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile combined up
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - You're ready to analyze templates!

5. **Stop when done**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## ☁️ Deploying to Azure (Production)

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Azure Developer CLI (azd) installed
- GitHub account

### Quick Start - One Command Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Template-Doctor/template-doctor.git
   cd template-doctor
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/full-setup.sh
   ```
   - Choose option 2 (Azure Cosmos DB - Production)
   - Configure GitHub OAuth when prompted
   - Get your GitHub Personal Access Token ready

3. **Login to Azure**
   ```bash
   az login
   azd auth login
   ```

4. **Deploy to Azure**
   ```bash
   azd provision
   ```
   - Enter environment name (e.g., "prod")
   - Select your Azure subscription
   - Choose Azure region (e.g., "eastus")
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for infrastructure provisioning
   
   Then deploy the application:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```
   - This builds and deploys the container image
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

5. **Done!**
   - Azure automatically provisions everything:
     - ✅ Cosmos DB database (serverless)
     - ✅ Container Apps (with auto-scaling)
     - ✅ Managed Identity (secure, no passwords)
     - ✅ All required permissions
   - Note the URL displayed at the end of deployment
   - Navigate to your Template Doctor instance

### Quick Redeploy (Already Configured)

If you already have `.env` configured and just need to redeploy:

```bash
./scripts/full-setup.sh --deploy
```

This command:
- ✅ Skips all configuration prompts
- ✅ Validates existing `.env` file
- ✅ Checks for version updates
- ✅ Installs dependencies and builds packages
- ✅ Runs `azd provision` (infrastructure)
- ✅ Runs `./scripts/deploy.sh` (container build + deploy)
- ✅ Displays your application URL

**When to use**: After initial setup, for quick updates or redeployments.

## 📋 What You Need to Prepare

### For Local Deployment
- ✅ GitHub account
- ✅ Docker Desktop running
- ⚠️ Optional: GitHub OAuth app (for authentication features)

### For Azure Production Deployment
- ✅ Azure subscription (with billing enabled)
- ✅ GitHub account
- ✅ GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `workflow` scopes
- ✅ GitHub OAuth app credentials:
  - Client ID
  - Client Secret
  - Callback URL set to: `https://<your-app>.azurecontainerapps.io/callback.html`

---

## 🔧 GitHub OAuth Setup (Required for Full Features)

### Create GitHub OAuth App

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/settings/developers
   - Click "OAuth Apps" → "New OAuth App"

2. **Configure the app**
   - **Application name**: `Template Doctor` (or your choice)
   - **Homepage URL**: 
     - Local: `http://localhost:3000`
     - Production: `https://<your-app>.azurecontainerapps.io`
   - **Authorization callback URL**:
     - Local: `http://localhost:3000/callback.html`
     - Production: `https://<your-app>.azurecontainerapps.io/callback.html`

3. **Get credentials**
   - Copy the **Client ID**
   - Generate and copy the **Client Secret**
   - Save both securely

4. **Enter during setup**
   - The setup script will prompt you for these values
   - They'll be automatically configured

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### Local Deployment Issues

**Problem**: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
- ✅ Solution: Make sure Docker Desktop is running

**Problem**: "Port 3000 already in use"
- ✅ Solution: Stop any apps using port 3000, or change port in `.env`

**Problem**: "Database connection failed"
- ✅ Solution: Make sure `MONGODB_URI` is NOT set in `.env` file (Docker handles this automatically)

### Azure Deployment Issues

**Problem**: "azd: command not found"
- ✅ Solution: Install Azure Developer CLI from https://aka.ms/azd-install

**Problem**: "Deployment failed - insufficient permissions"
- ✅ Solution: Make sure you have Owner or Contributor role on the Azure subscription

**Problem**: "GitHub OAuth not working"
- ✅ Solution: Verify callback URL in GitHub OAuth app matches your deployed URL exactly

**Problem**: "Container App provisioning timeout"
- ✅ Solution: The setup script uses two-step deployment (`azd provision` then `deploy.sh`) to avoid timeout issues

**Problem**: "Deployment stuck or blocking retries"
- ✅ Solution: Cancel stuck deployment:
  ```bash
  az deployment group cancel --resource-group <rg-name> --name container-app
  ```
  Or recreate everything:
  ```bash
  azd down --force --purge
  ./scripts/full-setup.sh --deploy
  ```

## 💰 Cost Estimate (Azure Production)

**Monthly costs** (approximate):
- Cosmos DB (serverless): $0-25 (depends on usage)
- Container Apps: $0-50 (depends on traffic)
- Container Registry: $5
- **Total**: ~$5-80/month (mostly pay-per-use)

**Note**: Azure Cosmos DB serverless only charges for actual usage. Low traffic = low cost.
